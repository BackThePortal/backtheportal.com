This is my first real personal website. Cool, right?

## Inspiration
I had tried to make a personal website several times, but every time I would abandon the project. I decided to finally
make one after seeing [Graham's website](https://grahamsh.com/). It's what inspired me to make
it with Nuxt, as well as including a blog.

You'll notice that this website's design is _fairly_ similar as that of Graham's; I used his website as an inspiration, but there are many differences:

- I used text buttons instead of icons in the navbar.

- This is just a test to see how the list works here, I don't know what else to say.

- A third element can't do any harm.
