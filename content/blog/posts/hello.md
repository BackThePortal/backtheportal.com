This is my first real personal website. Cool, right?

## Inspiration

I had tried to make a personal website several times, but every time I would
abandon the project. I decided to finally make one after seeing
[Graham's website](https://grahamsh.com/). It's what inspired me to make it with
Nuxt, as well as including a blog.

You'll notice that this website's design is _fairly_ similar as that of
Graham's; I used his website as an inspiration.

## Framework

For the first time, I'm using Nuxt! I had never used it before, I've always been
comfortable with just Vue, but damn, Nuxt is so cool.
